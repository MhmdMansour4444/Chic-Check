###  Chic Check is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Outfit"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.

###  Mastering AI Interaction: Unveiling the Power of Prompt Engineering:

- This project uses advanced prompt engineering techniques to optimize the interaction with natural language processing models. By skillfully crafting input instructions, we tailor the behavior of the models to achieve precise and efficient language understanding and generation for various tasks and preferences.
